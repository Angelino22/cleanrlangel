# Categorical DQN (C51)

## Overview

C51 introduces a distribution of perspective for DQN: instead of learning a single value for an action, C51 learns to predict a distribution of values for the action. With this perspective C51 introduces applies the Bellman's equation to learning the approximate value distribution. Empirically, C51 demonstrates impressive performance in ALE.

Below are our single-file implementations of C51:


## `c51_atari.py`

The [c51_atari.py](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/c51_atari.py) has the following features:

* For playing Atari games. It uses convolutional layers and common atari-based pre-processing techniques.
* Works with the Atari's pixel `Box` observation space of shape `(210, 160, 3)`
* Works with the `Discrete` action space

### Usage

```bash
poetry install -E atari
python cleanrl/c51_atari.py --env-id BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4
python cleanrl/c51_atari.py --env-id PongNoFrameskip-v4
```


### Explanation of the logged metrics

Running `python cleanrl/c51_atari.py` will automatically record various metrics such as actor or value losses in Tensorboard. Below is the documentation for these metrics:

* `charts/episodic_return`: episodic return of the game
* `charts/SPS`: number of steps per second
* `losses/loss`: the cross entropy loss between the $t$ step state value distribution and the projected $t+1$ step state value distribution
* `losses/q_values`: implemented as `(old_pmfs * q_network.atoms).sum(1)`, which is the sum of the probabily of getting returns $x$ (`old_pmfs`) multiplied by $x$ (`q_network.atoms`), averaged over the sample obtained from the replay buffer; useful when gauging if under or over estimation happens


### Implementation details

[c51_atari.py](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/c51_atari.py) is based on (Bellemare et al., 2017)[^1] but presents a few implementation differences:

1. (Bellemare et al., 2017)[^1] injects stochaticity by doing "on each frame the environment rejects the agent’s selected action with probability $p = 0.25$", but `c51_atari.py` does not do this
1. `c51_atari.py` use a self-contained evaluation scheme: `c51_atari.py` reports the episodic returns obtained throughout training, whereas (Bellemare et al., 2017)[^1] is trained with `--end-e=0.01` but reported episodic returns using a separate evaluation process with `--end-e=0.001` (See "5.2. State-of-the-Art Results" on page 7).
1. `c51_atari.py` rescales the gradient so that the norm of the parameters does not exceed `0.5` like done in PPO (:material-github: [ppo2/model.py#L102-L108](https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/ea25b9e8b234e6ee1bca43083f8f3cf974143998/baselines/ppo2/model.py#L102-L108)). 


### Experiment results

PR :material-github: [vwxyzjn/cleanrl#124](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/124) tracks our effort to conduct experiments, and the reprodudction instructions can be found at :material-github: [vwxyzjn/cleanrl/benchmark/c51](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/tree/master/benchmark/dqn).

Below are the average episodic returns for `c51_atari.py`. 


| Environment      | `c51_atari.py` 10M steps | (Bellemare et al., 2017, Figure 14)[^1] 50M steps | (Hessel et al., 2017, Figure 5)[^3] 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4      | 467.00 ± 96.11      | 748  | ~500 at 10M steps, ~600 at 50M steps
| PongNoFrameskip-v4  | 19.32 ± 0.92    |  20.9 |  ~20 10M steps, ~20 at 50M steps 
| BeamRiderNoFrameskip-v4   | 9986.96 ± 1953.30        | 14,074 | ~12000 10M steps, ~14000 at 50M steps 


Note that we save computational time by reducing timesteps from 50M to 10M, but our `c51_atari.py` scores the same or higher than (Mnih et al., 2015)[^1] in 10M steps.
